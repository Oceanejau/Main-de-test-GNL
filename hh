Avoid blaming yourself for your partner’s decisions. After your partner cheats, it’s normal to wonder if you could have done something to prevent it. However, you aren’t responsible for your partner’s actions. They made the decision to cheat, and it’s not your fault. Remind yourself that the only person you can control is you.[2]
If you start to blame yourself, tell yourself that you did nothing wrong. Say, “I can’t control anyone but me. I’m not to blame for someone else’s actions.”
Keep up with your self care so your needs are met. After a heartbreak, it’s tempting to curl up in a ball and spend the entire day eating ice cream. However, that will only make you feel worse. Instead, take good care of yourself by bathing, eating healthy meals, and tidying up your living space. Additionally, do nice things for yourself, like getting your favorite coffee, going for a walk, and seeing your friends.[5]
Try to do at least 1 nice thing for yourself everyday.
Let yourself feel your emotions, but try not to dwell on them. Take active breaks where you exercise or hang out with friends to give yourself a release.
Get tested for STDs if you’ve been sexually active with your partner. You likely don’t need to worry about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but it’s better to be safe and get tested. Go to your doctor or a local clinic to get an STD test. If you do have an STD, your doctor will offer you treatment for it.[7]
Try not to worry about possible STDs. You’re probably okay, but you need to be safe.
Decide what you expect from your relationship. After your partner cheats, you’ll need to decide if you want to stay with them or break-up. Knowing what you want from a relationship can help you make the best decision for you. Think about what you want in a partner and what boundaries you expect them to respect.[9]
For example, you might want a partner that shares your interests, has similar goals, and wants to spend a lot of time together. Your boundaries might be that you expect your partner to be faithful and you want them to trust you.
